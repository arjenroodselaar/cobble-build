# Cobble: a simple build system for modular software.

Cobble is a build system designed primarily for complex embedded software
builds, implemented in about 1000 lines of Python.

Cobble is designed to be flexible enough to build *most* systems Make can, and
has successfully replaced Make in several projects, though your mileage may
vary, since no two Make builds are alike.

Cobble builds are...

- **Modular.** Software is arranged into *packages*, each containing a portion
  of the build instructions. This ensures that you can reason locally about a
  library and its build recipe, and split common components out into e.g. Git
  submodules without having to copy-paste the build recipe.

- **Parameterized.** A single build *target* can describe multiple actual build
  products, depending on (for example) the architecture of the program that
  depends on it, or whatever other context information you desire.

- **Incremental.** Cobble puts a lot of work (and most of its code) into
  describing build dependencies *correctly,* so that incremental builds are fast
  and correct. Even if you change fundamental parameters of the build (like CPU
  architecture or CFLAGS) you don't need to clean before recompiling.

- **Parallel.** Cobble aggressively finds opportunities for parallelism in your
  build graph and chews through tasks using as many CPUs as you can give it,
  thanks to using [Ninja] under the hood.

- **Extensible.** Cobble itself ships with a plugin for describing how to build
  C code. Projects can add their own plugins as needed. (As of Cobble2, writing
  a plugin is even pretty easy.)

- **Flexible.** Cobble `BUILD` files are Python programs that can do arbitrary
  computation to compute the build graph (though not *during* the build). While
  the system nudges you toward deterministic repeatable builds, if you need to
  do something weird, we won't stop you.

Cobble is built on the shoulders of others:

 - [Ninja](http://martine.github.io/ninja/) does all the hard work behind the scenes.
 - The build model was originally dreamed up by [Anton Staaf] in his Make-based build system.
 - Aspects of the design are influenced by [SCons](http://scons.org), [GYP](https://code.google.com/p/gyp/),
   and [GN](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/gn).

## v1 and v2

You're reading the readme for the second version of Cobble. Cobble v2 is
_mostly_ compatible but there have been some changes to allow bugfixes and
simplifications in the core. If you need the older version, have a look at the
v1 branch.
